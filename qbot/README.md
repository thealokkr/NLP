About qbot

A question and answer bot powered by wolfram Alpha
I wrote this program to explain the idea of conversational UI in one of my talks and do not plan to accepts pull requests for new features. 
Bug fixes are welcome and feel free to fork and add new features. 

How to run it 

1. Go to https://developer.wolframalpha.com/portal/apisignup.html and create an wolfram idea
2. After registration generate an APP ID and replace the "appID" value in qBotLib.py file
3. Download the wolfram python binding from here https://github.com/mnielsen/mini_qa/blob/master/wolfram.py
4. Run the qBot.py and start asking questions
